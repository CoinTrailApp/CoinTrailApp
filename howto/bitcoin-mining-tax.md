## Mining Taxes 101

As a retail miner, there are some tasks you must do to properly report taxes by the end of the year as a hobby or quarterly as a business.
- Taxable income on rewarded coin
- Capital gain/loss if disposed any coin to cover expense

The most annoying thing is: recording **Reward Transactions** to have the correct cost basis.

## Mining Pool, Wallet and Exchange

There are few different ways to setup the mining operation, here is a prefered way to set up with a mining pool:
- Miners send hash to Mining Pool (taxable event)
- Reward will be deposited into a Pool Wallet then occasionally transfers to Your Wallet
- Occasionally you transfers coins to Exchange for Fiat (taxable event)
