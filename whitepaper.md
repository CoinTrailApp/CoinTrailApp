# Abstract

Booming in cryptocurrency creates tax filing challenge for individuals who own this asset class. Unlike, traditional finance where an institution can hand out 8949 tax form at the end of the year, the crypto exchanges are not able to do so due to lack of origin Cost Basic when assets being transferred cross exchanges.
In this paper, CoinTrail is proposing a very simple and effectively algorithm to keep track of Cost Basic and Tax Calculation Engine which helps easy the mind of crypto HODLers.

# Introduction

Unlike existing solutions on the market with SaaS based approach, CoinTrail is a Crypto Tax Calculator in your pocket. Just an app that runs locally on the mobile device, with no server, no backend, no signup...to ensure privacy of assets owner, offer a better user experience and cheaper service.
CoinTrail automatically manages tax-lots when you make a trade or transfer based on the tax strategy of your choice. It shows you which lot will be used prior to making a sale, which one will be reserved if you make a withdrawal and restore exact Cost Basic as deposit into other exchanges.
Fees are another mysterious thing when you trade on exchanges. Many exchanges don't show fees when doing a swap or convert from one crypto asset to another. This leads to confusion when calculating Cost Basic, lowering tax deduction. CoinTrail addresses this problem by estimating fees using historical price discovery when permitted.
Off balance tracking is another cool feature. CoinTrail automatically matches all the withdrawals with deposits. For any withdrawal without a deposit will treat as off balance. This happens when transfering assets to a Cold Storage.
