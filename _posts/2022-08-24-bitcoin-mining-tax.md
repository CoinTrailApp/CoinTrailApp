## Mining Taxes 101

As a retail miner, there are some tasks you must do to properly report taxes by the end of the year as a hobby or quarterly as a business.
- Taxable income on rewarded coin
- Capital gain/loss if disposed any coin to cover expenses

The most annoying tax calculation is attributing **Reward Transactions** with the correct cost basis.

### Mining Pool, Wallet and Exchange

There are few different ways to setup the mining operation, here is a prefered way to set up with a mining pool:
- Miners send hash to Mining Pool (taxable event)
- Reward will be deposited into a Pool Wallet then occasionally transfers to Your Wallet
- Occasionally you transfer coins to Exchange for Fiat (taxable event)

### CoinTrail To Rescue

With CoinTrail integrated directly into the mining pool, **Reward** and **Withdraw** transactions are synced to your device. Cost Basis, Taxable Income, and Gain/Loss are automatically recorded. Income can be drilled down monthly for details, and trends.
